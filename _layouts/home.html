            <p class="main-text">Hi there, I'm Arda, a software engineer who architects and develops software to <a href="#">improve users' experiences</a>.
                Previously at <a href="#">BP3</a>, I have experience in <a href="#">full-stack</a>, <a href="#">custom applications</a>,
                and <a href="#">experimental applications</a> development, as well as <a href="#">consulting</a>. I am also
                working on side projects, like <a href="#">Budgeting</a>.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">I am currently focused on growing my <a href="#">Data Science and Machine Learning</a> skills, particularly interested
                in how I can utilize Machine Learning to provide better experiences for end users.</p>
            <p class="sub-text">On my own time, I enjoy learning about other <a href="#">software engineering branches</a>, while <a href="#">taking photos</a>,
                playing instruments, and playing video games to unwind.</p>
