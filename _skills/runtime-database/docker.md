description: "I've mainly used docker to host environments (such as NodeJS) and databases (such as ElasticSearch, MongoDB, and Redis), with docker-compose used to ensure all required dependencies can be run at the same time during development. When developing at home, I run my docker containers on the home server using Rancher (a web UI to control docker images and containers)."
