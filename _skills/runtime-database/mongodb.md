description: "I've used with MongoDB with Mongoose, a NodeJS object modeling tool for MongoDB, for my budgeting application. It's currently my go-to database system as I prefer NoSQL databases, since they are easier to scale, provide greater flexibility when storing new data models, and have large open source communities (although generally requiring relationships between data to be managed extensively in code)."
