description: "Git is my preferred source control tool, which I have made use of extensively both for work and personal projects. While merge conflicts are not an issue for personal projects, Git proved to be extremely useful for work projects, since multiple people work on the same codebase at the same time and are likely to affect each other. Git's great automated merge conflict tools, rebasing tools (ability to pick, reword, squash, and ignore commits), and the ability to revert to previous commits and even actions (e.g. can revert an accidental rebase) makes it a must have a tool for all developers."
