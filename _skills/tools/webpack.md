description: "With Angular 2+ for Brazos Portal (2.0), I've also started using Webpack to package applications into bundles, rather than using Gulp and plugins. This was because Webpack had executed more of the transpiling actions concurrently, leading to faster build times (important during development when you want to see changes on-the-fly). In addition, Webpack provided analysis of bundles, helping to reduce the size for production use of enterprise software (faster load times)."
