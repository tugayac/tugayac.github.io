description: "Whenever I've dabbled with NodeJS, I've always used ExpressJS, as it has always been the most popular web framework for NodeJS, meaning my barrier to entry into the NodeJS community would be lower. I am currently working on a budgeting application and have decided to build my API using ExpressJS."
