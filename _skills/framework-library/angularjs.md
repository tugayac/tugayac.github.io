description: "I've used AngularJS for various projects at BP3, ranging from consulting projects to BrazosOpen. Consulting projects involved developing full-stack applications as well as extending existing applications written in AngularJS. BrazosOpen was a full-stack application that I was involved in developing. Although I've worked extensively with AngularJS, I do not enjoy working with its syntax and confusing change detection lifecycle. Nevertheless, AngularJS has taught me the importance of modular components."
