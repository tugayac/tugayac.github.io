description: "I've used Angular 2+ to build a web application from the ground up. Having used AngularJS before, I believe Angular 2+ is a great improvement over AngularJS. Being able to develop natively in TypeScript helps with better project structure and coding practices. Furthermore, having granular control over change detection (by binding/unbinding the change detector and the use of NgZone), as well as lack of scoping issues makes Angular 2+ my current favorite front-end web application framework."
