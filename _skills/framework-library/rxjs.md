description: "I was introduced to RxJS when I started using Angular 2+, which implicitly makes use of RxJS. Although reactive programming felt weird at first, it now feels very natural to deal with data streams and their change propagation. Since browsers are event-driven, RxJS works really well at converting event-triggered data changes into data streams (such as observables), while reacting to these data changes feels quite natural. On the server side, reactive programming is useful especially when dealing with websockets, which are data streams themselves."
