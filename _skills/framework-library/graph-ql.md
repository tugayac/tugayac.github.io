description: "Having been introduced to GraphQL recently, it has taken me some time to get used to its syntax and the AST it provides in the back-end to fetch results for queries. However, I currently understand how it works and can see its potential benefits as an alternative to a pure REST API (GraphQL still uses REST principles, but only exposes one endpoint where requests in GraphQL format can be made). Being able to define a schema with descriptions of each field and request only the desired fields from the front-end application is helpful in creating well-documented and eliminating clutter (as with REST APIs, multiple endpoints need to be created to handle nested object requests)."
