description: "With all of the full-stack applications at BP3 using Java for their backend, it made sense to pick Spring Boot for as the backend. Since Spring Boot provides annotations to easily set up REST endpoints as well as frameworks to communicate with databases, it allowed us to focus on implementing the business logic. While other frameworks such as the <i>Play</i> Framework could also be used, Spring Boot is well documented and offers a wide variety of official (such as the <i>Spring Security</i> Framework) and third-party extensions."
