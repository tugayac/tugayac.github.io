description: "I've used Go for concurrent programming and was pleased with the relative ease of being sending messages between spawned \"goroutines\". However, I find forced composition to be slightly weird compared to inheritance, perhaps because I'm used to Object-Oriented Languages like Java, JavaScript, C#, and TypeScript."
