description: "I've made extensive use of JavaScript for applications developed in AngularJS and consulting projects. Recently, I've starting experimenting with ES2015 language features such as generator functions and static imports in NodeJS. While JavaScript occasionally requires extra tools to enforce coding styles, it's a great language to quickly prototype web applications (and if using NodeJS, a simple backend)."
