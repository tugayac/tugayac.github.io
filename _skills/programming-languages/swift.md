description: "I recently began using Swift to develop an iOS 11 application to demonstrate QR code detection using the new iOS Vision Framework. I'm currently Swift to develop the budgeting application and enjoy a lot of the features the language has to offer, especially optional variables, various way to handle nil variables, and ability to extend class that you don't have the original source code for."
