description: "I've used TypeScript to develop web applications with Angular 2+. It's great to have a statically typed object-oriented language that can be used as an alternative to JavaScript, as TypeScript allows for better structured projects (which lead to more maintainable code). Additionally, TypeScript makes it easier to switch between working on the backend and frontend, as Java feels similar to TypeScript."
